Brain Tumor Detection & Segmentation Using Deep Learning

I recently worked on an advanced medical imaging AI project for brain tumor analysis that combines classification and segmentation techniques.

ðŸ”¹ Classification: Fine-tuned a pre-trained ResNet50 model to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Segmentation: Utilized a pre-trained U-Net model to segment and localize tumor regions at the pixel level for more precise analysis.

Key Achievements:
âœ… Applied transfer learning for better performance with limited data.
âœ… Performed advanced preprocessing and augmentation to improve model generalization.
âœ… Achieved both tumor detection and precise segmentation in a streamlined workflow.

This project highlights how AI and deep learning can support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
